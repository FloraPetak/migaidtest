When entering Hungary at the southern borders, they are registered as asylum seekers and sent to one of the Hungarian refugee camps. They need to get there on their own and within 48 hours. Without speaking Hungarian and receiving detailed instructions on how to get there, they have difficulties finding their way. Most of them have come from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, several African or Balkan countries with their family and children and have travelled a long way without enough money, food and hygienic conditions, so they are not in the best condition.

**The Migration Aid volunteers decided to help them find which trains or buses take them to their destination and give them food, drinks, personal hygiene products and a couple of good words while they are transiting at train stations.**

If you want to join the initiative, there are many ways you can help! Join our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary) for regularly updated information.

**Come to the main train stations of Budapest** where you can find our volunteers (usually wearing a pin with the Migration Aid logo) and join them giving food, drinks and information to arriving refugees. Even if you only have an hour, it would be very helpful, especially if you speak any languages that the refugees might speak!

**We also accept donations** of water, fruit and sandwich ingredients, snacks at the following address:

{% include alert info='Attention, we have moved since 27/07 to the a new address!' %}

      Kalicka Bistro
      Rottenbiller street 32, 7th district, Budapest 1077
      Accepting donations: every day 15.00 - 20.00

Things most needed:

For the moment, the new donation center will **only accept BKK tickets, water, fruits, and basic food** (0,5 l natural water, apple, banana, snacks, biscuits and sandwich ingredients such as bread, butter, cheese, paprika, sandwich cream natur or with vegetables), and for packing them **the blue IKEA bags, small bags, garbage bags, rubber gloves and aluminium foil**, which will be distributed at the train stations of Budapest for transferring immigrants.

{% include alert info='Please note that most of the refugees are Muslims which means they do not consume anything that has pork or alcohol.' %}

For the time being, please do **not** bring other donations such as clothes, toys, hygiene items, blankets and other items intended for use in the refugee camps.
We are working on a solution to be able to receive donations to be sent to the camps. As soon as this has been realised, we will communicate it to you.

In the meanwhile, we really **need more volunteers at the train stations** to give information and directions to the immigrants. Please look for our volunteers at the train stations of Budapest (Nyugati, DÃ©li, Keleti) and offer your help directly!

We **need help at our storage room** to receive and select the donations and put together personal packages. If you are able to help, please come to our storage room at Rottenbiller street 32., Budapest, between 15.00 and 20.00 any days of the week.

If you live far away but you would still like to donate something, we can recommend for example **online shopping**, at Tesco or GRoby, paid online and shipped to the storage room between 15:00 and 20:00.

**We also need the help of interpreters and translators**, especially in the following languages: Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, Pastu, Turkish, French, English, Albanian. Unfortunately, many refugees are in poor health conditions, we often **need medical help, volunteer doctors and nurses** are more than welcome to join our initiative! If you can help with interpretation or medical aid, please come to any train station in Budapest and offer your assistance to the volunteers there or let us know your contact details and availability also through migrationaidhungary@gmail.com

**IMPORTANT**

- It is recommended to use plastic gloves when giving out food or treating sick refugees for your own safety
- It is NOT recommended to transport refugees in your own vehicle even with valid, but especially with expired papers because it can be considered human trafficking
- It is NOT recommended to lend your phone to refugees to make calls or send sms home, because you cannot be sure who they are messaging and it might be considered as crime
- Do not interfere with the work of the police. We are there to help each other and collaborate peacefully.
- Before taking photos or videos of the refugees, please ask their permission and do not publish their full name with their photos on any platform for their safety and the safety of their families staying in their home country
- It is not recommended to share your personal details, address on Facebook, neither the fact that you might take a refugee home to offer them showering and sleeping facilities
- If possible, please do not show pity. Smile and be direct while emphatic!
