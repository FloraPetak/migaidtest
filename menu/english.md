When entering Hungary at the southern borders, they are registered as asylum seekers and sent to one of the Hungarian refugee camps. They need to get there on their own and within 48 hours. Without speaking Hungarian and receiving detailed instructions on how to get there, they have difficulties finding their way. Most of them have come from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, several African or Balkan countries with their family and children and have travelled a long way without enough money, food and hygienic conditions, so they are not in the best condition.

**The Migration Aid volunteers decided to help them find which trains or buses take them to their destination and give them food, drinks, personal hygiene products and a couple of good words while they are transiting at train stations.**

If you want to join the initiative, there are many ways you can help! Join our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary) for regularly updated information.

**Come to the main train stations of Budapest** where you can find our volunteers (usually wearing a pin with the Migration Aid logo) and join them giving food, drinks and information to arriving refugees. Even if you only have an hour, it would be very helpful, especially if you speak any languages that the refugees might speak!

**Donation Centers and Storage Locations**

At the moment we DO NOT COLLECT ANY TYPE OF CLOTHES. Please follow our Facebook page where we post the actual needs daily and we will communicate when we collect clothes again. Thank you!
Please only bring those items to our storage room which are listed above. There is a reason why the list is short and that is your immense generosity, since we received a tremendous amount of donations in the past few days and many of you informed us about online orders to be shipped in the next two weeks but our storage facilities are limited. Therefore, we will only collect clothes, toys, hygiene items again, once the accumulated storages are reduced. We will update the donation list on Facebook every morning 7 am CET with the daily needs.

If you would like to donate a larger quantity of goods or services, please contact us via adomany@migrationaid.net to discuss the details. Thank you!

**IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO DONATE MONEY**

Migration Aid cannot accept money directly. However, if you would like to give money, you can donate to **Mikszáth Pharmacy’s bank account (Egészségért Foundation)**. The pharmacy has been supporting our work with pharmaceuticals for a while now. Though refugees are entitled for free basic health care services, they need to pay for medicines, and first aid products. 

When you donate, please send an e-mail to the adomany@migrationaid.net address with the amount you have given, so we can also keep track of the donations.

**Volunteering**
In the meanwhile, we really **need more volunteers at the train stations** to give information and directions to the immigrants. Please look for our volunteers at the train stations of Budapest (Nyugati, Déli, Keleti) and offer your help directly!

We **need help at our donation center** at versen utca, to receive and select the donations and put together personal packages. If you are able to help, please come to one of our storage facilities, any days of the week. Watch for opening times!

**We also need the help of interpreters and translators**, especially in the following languages: Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, Pastu, Turkish, French, English, Albanian. Unfortunately, many refugees are in poor health conditions, we often **need medical help, volunteer doctors and nurses** are more than welcome to join our initiative! If you can help with interpretation or medical aid, please come to any train station in Budapest and offer your assistance to the volunteers there or let us know your contact details and availability also through migrationaidhungary@gmail.com

**IMPORTANT**

- It is recommended to use plastic gloves when giving out food or treating sick refugees for your own safety
- It is NOT recommended to transport refugees in your own vehicle even with valid, but especially with expired papers because it can be considered human trafficking
- It is NOT recommended to lend your phone to refugees to make calls or send sms home, because you cannot be sure who they are messaging and it might be considered as crime
- Do not interfere with the work of the police. We are there to help each other and collaborate peacefully.
- Before taking photos or videos of the refugees, please ask their permission and do not publish their full name with their photos on any platform for their safety and the safety of their families staying in their home country
- It is not recommended to share your personal details, address on Facebook, neither the fact that you might take a refugee home to offer them showering and sleeping facilities
- If possible, please do not show pity. Smile and be direct while emphatic!
