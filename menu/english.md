When entering Hungary at the southern borders, they are registered as asylum seekers and sent to one of the Hungarian refugee camps. They need to get there on their own and within 48 hours. Without speaking Hungarian and receiving detailed instructions on how to get there, they have difficulties finding their way. Most of them have come from Afghanistan, Syria, Iran, several African or Balkan countries with their family and children and have travelled a long way without enough money, food and hygienic conditions, so they are not in the best condition.

**The Migration Aid volunteers decided to help them find which trains or buses take them to their destination and give them food, drinks, personal hygiene products and a couple of good words while they are transiting at train stations.**

If you want to join the initiative, there are many ways you can help! Join our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/migrationaidhungary) for regularly updated information.

**Come to the main train stations of Budapest** where you can find our volunteers (usually wearing a pin with the Migration Aid logo) and join them giving food, drinks and information to arriving refugees. Even if you only have an hour, it would be very helpful, especially if you speak any languages that the refugees might speak!

In the meanwhile, we really **need more volunteers at the train stations** to give information and directions to the immigrants. Please look for our volunteers at the train stations of Budapest (Nyugati, Déli, Keleti) and offer your help directly!

We **need help at our donation center** at 32 Arany János street, to receive and select the donations and put together personal packages. If you are able to help, please come to one of our storage facilities, any days of the week. Watch for opening times!

If you live far away but you would still like to donate something, we can recommend for example **online shopping**, at Tesco or GRoby, paid online and shipped to our donation center at Ébredés Alapítvány. Watch for opening time of storage facilities when setting delivery attributes!

**We also need the help of interpreters and translators**, especially in the following languages: Arabic, Urdu, Farsi, Pastu, Turkish, French, English, Albanian. Unfortunately, many refugees are in poor health conditions, we often **need medical help, volunteer doctors and nurses** are more than welcome to join our initiative! If you can help with interpretation or medical aid, please come to any train station in Budapest and offer your assistance to the volunteers there or let us know your contact details and availability also through migrationaidhungary@gmail.com

**IMPORTANT**

- It is recommended to use plastic gloves when giving out food or treating sick refugees for your own safety
- It is NOT recommended to transport refugees in your own vehicle even with valid, but especially with expired papers because it can be considered human trafficking
- It is NOT recommended to lend your phone to refugees to make calls or send sms home, because you cannot be sure who they are messaging and it might be considered as crime
- Do not interfere with the work of the police. We are there to help each other and collaborate peacefully.
- Before taking photos or videos of the refugees, please ask their permission and do not publish their full name with their photos on any platform for their safety and the safety of their families staying in their home country
- It is not recommended to share your personal details, address on Facebook, neither the fact that you might take a refugee home to offer them showering and sleeping facilities
- If possible, please do not show pity. Smile and be direct while emphatic!
